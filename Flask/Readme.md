# Flask

## Overview

This folder is my learning workspace for Flask, where I create and experiment with various web application projects. It serves as a sandbox for exploring Flask's capabilities and building practical web solutions.

## Projects

Add your Flask projects here as you develop them. Each project demonstrates different aspects of Flask functionality.

## Project Structure

- **`venv/`** - Local virtual environment with Flask dependencies
- Individual project folders for specific applications

## Getting Started

Install Flask using the local virtual environment or your preferred method:

```sh
pip install flask
```

To run a Flask application:

```sh
python app.py
```

## Purpose

This is a learning and experimentation space. Projects range from simple scripts to more complex web applications as I continue to develop my Flask expertise.
